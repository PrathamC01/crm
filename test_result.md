# Test Result Log

## Original User Problem Statement
The user requested to:
1. Remove the company approval flow completely (already done)
2. Implement a validation process to classify companies as "cold" or "hot" based on business criteria
3. Add 3-level cascading dropdowns (Country → State → City) with predefined values
4. Ensure validated companies appear immediately in lead section dropdown without status display

## Current Implementation Status
- Backend: Models and schemas updated with lead_status, country, state, city fields
- Backend: Basic validation logic implemented in Company model
- Backend: Geographic data APIs partially implemented
- Frontend: CompanyForm.jsx partially updated with cascading dropdowns
- Issue: CORS/URL mismatch preventing frontend-backend communication

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
1. Test all new API endpoints for geographic data (countries, states, cities)
2. Test company creation with new validation logic 
3. Test company listing to ensure lead_status is properly set
4. Verify database schema changes are working

### Frontend Testing Guidelines
1. Test cascading dropdown functionality (Country → State → City)
2. Test company creation form with new fields
3. Test integration with backend APIs
4. Verify lead section dropdown shows companies without status

### Communication Protocol with Testing Agents
- Always provide complete context about what features to test
- Specify exact API endpoints and expected responses
- Include validation criteria for "cold/hot" classification
- Request specific test scenarios for cascading dropdowns

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed lead_status should NOT appear in lead section dropdown (store internally only)
- Focus on seamless 3-level dropdown experience
- Ensure immediate company availability after creation

## Test Results Summary
(Will be updated by testing agents)

## Known Issues
1. CORS/URL mismatch issue preventing frontend-backend communication
2. CompanyForm.jsx needs completion of cascading dropdown integration
3. Lead section dropdown needs update to hide status display

## Next Steps
1. Fix CORS/URL issue
2. Complete frontend implementation
3. Test complete flow end-to-end
