# Test Result Log

## Original User Problem Statement
The user requested to:
1. Remove the company approval flow completely (already done)
2. Implement a validation process to classify companies as "cold" or "hot" based on business criteria
3. Add 3-level cascading dropdowns (Country ‚Üí State ‚Üí City) with predefined values
4. Ensure validated companies appear immediately in lead section dropdown without status display

## Current Implementation Status
- Backend: Models and schemas updated with lead_status, country, state, city fields
- Backend: Basic validation logic implemented in Company model
- Backend: Geographic data APIs partially implemented
- Frontend: CompanyForm.jsx partially updated with cascading dropdowns
- Issue: CORS/URL mismatch preventing frontend-backend communication

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
1. Test all new API endpoints for geographic data (countries, states, cities)
2. Test company creation with new validation logic 
3. Test company listing to ensure lead_status is properly set
4. Verify database schema changes are working

### Frontend Testing Guidelines
1. Test cascading dropdown functionality (Country ‚Üí State ‚Üí City)
2. Test company creation form with new fields
3. Test integration with backend APIs
4. Verify lead section dropdown shows companies without status

### Communication Protocol with Testing Agents
- Always provide complete context about what features to test
- Specify exact API endpoints and expected responses
- Include validation criteria for "cold/hot" classification
- Request specific test scenarios for cascading dropdowns

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed lead_status should NOT appear in lead section dropdown (store internally only)
- Focus on seamless 3-level dropdown experience
- Ensure immediate company availability after creation
