The previous AI engineer successfully brought a CRM application from 0 to 1, fixing numerous technical issues including broken APIs, environment misconfigurations, Pydantic v2 migration, and database errors. They also implemented centralized error handling and lead status management. However, the work pivoted to designing a new enterprise platform. Initially, this was pursued as a separate  application. A critical correction from the user redirected the AI to integrate all new functionalities (Dashboard, Leads, Opportunities, and a comprehensive Masters module, along with Redis for sessions and MinIO for storage) into the *existing*  application, strictly using PostgreSQL. The AI successfully merged the backend components, implemented Redis/MinIO (mocked for testing), fixed numerous import and database connectivity issues, and completed all Masters and Dashboard backend API integrations, which passed comprehensive tests. The current focus is on building the React frontend components and automated testing.

<product_requirements>
The initial goal was to fix and stabilize an existing React/FastAPI CRM, including API correctness, centralized error handling, and lead status functionality. The core product requirement evolved significantly to develop a modular, scalable enterprise sales and product management platform. This platform must include:
-   **Main Application Tabs:** Dashboard, Leads, Opportunities, and Masters.
-   **Dashboard:** Department-specific views (Sales, Presales, Product, General Overview) with key metrics.
-   **Leads Module:** Contact, Company, Lead Management.
-   **Opportunities Module:** Opportunity, Quotation Management.
-   **Masters Module (17+ entities):** Product, Price List, Product Pricing, Group, Product Grouping, Tax, User, Roles, Department, Designation, Permission, Discount, Product Calculation, State, City, Industry Category, Unit of Measure (UOM).
-   **Business Logic:** Autogeneration for names/SKUs, comprehensive approval workflows for masters, UOM support with conversion factors for products/pricing/quotations, role-based access control (read/write/approve), and configurable dashboards.
-   **Technical Constraints:** All new functionality *must* be integrated into the existing  codebase. Persistence must use PostgreSQL and MongoDB (for logs as previously configured), with Redis for session management and MinIO for media uploads.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python web framework for backend APIs.
-   **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the frontend UI.
-   **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for CRM data.
-   **SQLAlchemy**: Python SQL toolkit and ORM.
-   **Pydantic (v2)**: Data validation for Python.
-   **Redis**: In-memory data store for session management.
-   **MinIO**: Object storage for media uploads (currently mocked).
-   **Supervisor**: Process control system.
-   **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with  (FastAPI) and  (React) directories within the  root.


-   : The central FastAPI application. It was significantly modified to include all new routers for master data, dashboard, session management, and file uploads. It also now registers centralized exception handlers.
-   : (NEW) Defines all the SQLAlchemy ORM models for the 17+ master data entities (e.g., Product, PriceList, UOM, User, etc.), including their relationships. This file is crucial for the new business logic.
-   : (NEW) Contains Pydantic schemas for request and response validation of all master data operations, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
-   : (NEW) Implements the business logic for CRUD operations on all master data, interacting with the database models.
-   : (NEW) Defines the API endpoints for all master data, linking requests to the corresponding service logic.
-   , , : (NEW) These files establish the backend for the new Dashboard module, including data models, business logic, and API routes.
-    & : (NEW) Utility files for integrating Redis for session management and MinIO for file storage.
-   : (MODIFIED) Updated to support Redis-based session management for user authentication and authorization.
-   : (MODIFIED) Extended with new endpoints for user login, logout, session information retrieval, and file uploads.
-   : (MODIFIED) The main React component, now handling the overall application routing to include the new Dashboard, Leads, Opportunities, and Masters modules, along with authentication.
-    and : (NEW) Establish the overall frontend layout, including a main layout wrapper, sidebar, and header for consistent navigation across the new modules.
-   : (NEW) Provides a React Context API for managing user authentication state across the frontend application.
-    & : (NEW Directories & Files) Contains the new React pages and components for the Dashboard and Masters modules, providing the UI for these functionalities.
-   : (MODIFIED) Enhanced to integrate with the new authentication context and handle MinIO-related API calls.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Fully detail the  with all request/response examples for every API.
-   Implement the comprehensive Leads and Opportunities modules (backend models, schemas, services, routers).
-   Address the SQLAlchemy  about relationship overlap.
-   Continue creating the remaining frontend UI components for the Leads and Opportunities modules.
-   Generate automated testing scripts for both the frontend and backend.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with fully implementing the comprehensive, modular, and scalable enterprise sales and product management platform into the existing  application. This involved consolidating the separate  effort into the main CRM.

The AI has successfully completed the following:
1.  **Backend Integration:** Merged all previously designed master data models, schemas, services, and routers into the  directory structure.
2.  **Infrastructure Setup:** Integrated Redis for session management and MinIO for file storage (currently using mock implementations in development).
3.  **Module Implementation (Backend):**
    *   **Masters Module:** All 17+ master entities (e.g., Product, UOM, Price List, User, Roles, Departments) are fully implemented on the backend with CRUD operations, data validation, and correct relationships, integrated into the existing PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Dashboard Module:** The backend components for the Dashboard (models, services, API routes for Sales, Presales, Product, and Overview Dashboards) have been created and are functional.
    *   **Authentication & File Uploads:** The authentication dependencies and routes have been enhanced to support Redis-based sessions, and file upload endpoints for MinIO have been added (mocked).
4.  **Debugging & Stabilization:** Resolved numerous critical issues including:
    *   Import errors due to changes in module structure.
    *   Database connectivity issues with PostgreSQL (including installing and configuring PostgreSQL on the system).
    *   SQLAlchemy relationship issues and Pydantic v2 compatibility problems (e.g.,  vs ).
    *   Service startup issues.
5.  **Backend Testing:** Comprehensive backend API tests for all Masters and Dashboard endpoints, session management, and mocked file uploads were executed and passed with 100% success rate.
6.  **Codebase Cleanup:** Removed all redundant files and directories from the earlier, separate  development attempt, ensuring a clean and consolidated codebase.
7.  **Frontend Structure (In Progress):** The AI has just started creating the foundational frontend components and structure for the new enterprise platform. This includes:
    *   Creating a  for the overall application layout.
    *   Implementing  and  for navigation.
    *   Setting up  for global authentication state management.
    *   Enhancing  for new API calls.
    *   Creating initial pages and components for the Dashboard module (, , , , , ).
    *   Creating initial pages and components for the Masters module (, , , ).
    *   Updating  to manage routing for these new modules and authentication.

The application currently has a fully functional and tested backend for the integrated CRM and the new Masters and Dashboard modules, with Redis for session management and MinIO for file uploads (mocked), all using PostgreSQL. The frontend is in the initial phase of component creation for these new modules.

<optional_next_step>
Continue creating the remaining frontend UI components for the Leads and Opportunities modules, and then generate automated testing scripts for both frontend and backend.
