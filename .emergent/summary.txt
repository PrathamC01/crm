The AI engineer successfully built the Company Management module for Swayatta 4.0. The work progressed chronologically, starting with codebase exploration (CRM with React frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database). Initial setup involved troubleshooting environment issues, specifically with  configuration, yarn run v1.22.22

After environment stability, the core task was to implement a detailed JSON schema for the Company Management form, including comprehensive validation, role-based restrictions, and business rules. This involved significant modifications to backend models, schemas, services, and routers, as well as extensive updates to the React frontend components for form fields, validation, and navigation.

Subsequent iterations focused on refining specific form behaviors: first, integrating a JSON schema for industry/sub-industry and compliance fields with conditional display and regex validation. Second, converting a multi-select dropdown for Products and Services in the Lead form to a checkbox-based multi-select. Finally, implementing a  dropdown in the Lead form that conditionally shows/hides and enables/disables a Tender Details section based on the selected sub-type, complete with its own required fields and validation. Throughout, the engineer rigorously tested functionality via screenshots and confirmed compliance with user requests.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective was to create a comprehensive Company Management module form for Swayatta 4.0. This form required all listed fields to be mandatory, adhering to strict validation rules, role-based restrictions, and defined business rules. Key requirements included:
- **Form Sections & Fields**: Basic Information (Company Name, Parent Company, GST/International ID, Company Type, Industry/Sub-Industry, Registered Address, Annual Revenue), Identification & Compliance (Supporting Documents, Verification Source/Date/By), Hierarchy & Linkages, System Metadata (Created By/Date, Approval Stage, Status, Change Log ID). All fields .
- **Validation Rules**: No blank fields, GST/International ID format validation, duplicate company checks, document upload validation (PDF/JPG/PNG, <=10MB, required by type).
- **Role-based Access**: Admin (create/edit), Salesperson (submit for approval), L1 Sales Head (approve non-GST).
- **System Behavior**: Auto-fetch company data (later clarified as manual verification), auto-tagging based on revenue (>â‚¹2 Cr), parent-child hierarchy display, SLA for Admin verification, audit logging for all CRUD.
- **Output**: JSON schema for direct integration.

Subsequent refinements included:
- **Company Compliance Identifiers**:  enum updated to , , , . Conditional visibility/requirement for / (for domestic) vs. / (for international).
- **Lead Form - Products & Services**: Multi-select fields for products and services displayed as checkboxes, allowing multiple selections, with submission blocked until at least one product or service is chosen.
- **Lead Form - Lead Sub Type & Tender Details**:  dropdown with , , ,  options. A  section is hidden/disabled if  is , otherwise shown and required (with , , ).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), PostgreSQL (Database), MongoDB (Legacy, not used for new Company module).
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Tailwind CSS, Pydantic (data validation), SQLAlchemy (ORM), Uvicorn (ASGI server), Vite (frontend tooling), Yarn (package manager), Supervisor (process manager).
- **Architectural Patterns**: API contracts, Component-based UI, State Management, Conditional Rendering, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Environment Variable usage.

<code_architecture>


-   : Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM model for . Modified to include new fields like , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . Also updated to use  instead of .
-   : Defines Pydantic schemas for  data validation (request and response). Updated extensively to match the new model fields, strict validations (regex, enum, length), and ensure  for all fields, and to use  instead of  for Pydantic v2.
-   : Contains business logic for Company CRUD operations. Updated to handle the new fields, validation rules (e.g., duplicate checks, revenue auto-tagging), and approval workflow logic.
-   : Defines FastAPI endpoints for Company operations. Updated to utilize the new schemas and service methods for handling comprehensive company data. Response models were adjusted for proper serialization.
-   : The React component rendering the Company Management form. This file received substantial updates:
    -   Implemented all sections (Basic Information, Identification & Compliance, Registered Address, Hierarchy & Linkages, System Metadata).
    -   Integrated dynamic dropdowns for Industry/Sub-Industry.
    -   Implemented conditional visibility for GST/PAN vs. Tax ID/CRN based on .
    -   Added client-side validation using regex patterns for identifiers and enforced all fields as required.
    -   Implemented  for product/service checkboxes.
    -   Updated state management to handle new form fields and validation errors.
-   : Displays the list of companies. Updated to reflect new company data fields and their display.
-   : The main page for Company Management. Created to host the  and  components.
-    and : Modified to add the Companies navigation link between Dashboard and Leads.
-   : Added an  helper function for consistent API calls.
-   : The environment file for backend. Updated  to the correct connection string during troubleshooting.
-   : Database seeding script. Modified to update the initial company data to match the new  schema and resolve  issues.
-   : Backend entry point. Modified to change the Uvicorn host/port from  to .
-   : The React component for the Create New Lead form.
    -   Initially modified to integrate Products and Services as multi-select dropdowns.
    -   Later refactored to use checkbox-based multi-select for Products and Services, including options and validation.
    -   Further modified to add the  dropdown and a conditionally visible/required  section with , , and  fields.
    -   Implemented validation for at least one product/service selection and conditional requirement for tender details.
-   : Frontend environment file. Updated  to  to correctly point to the backend.

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer successfully implemented all explicitly requested features and confirmed their functionality. There are no pending tasks that were explicitly asked to be worked on and left incomplete by the previous engineer.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the  dropdown and the conditional Tender Details section within the Create New Lead form.

Specifically, the  file was updated to:
-   Introduce a  dropdown with options: , , , .
-   Implement conditional rendering and disabling of a Tender Details section. If  is , this section is hidden and disabled. For any other  (, , ), the Tender Details section is displayed and its fields become required.
-   The Tender Details section includes three required fields:  (string, minLength 2, maxLength 100),  (string, minLength 2, maxLength 200), and  (date format string).
-   Validation logic was updated to enforce that the  object is required when  is not , and that its individual fields are required under those conditions.
-   The form's submit button is blocked until all validations pass, including the new conditional  validation.
-   The implementation adheres to the provided JSON schema for ,  structure, and conditional UI rules (visibility, interactions).
-   The previous implementation of checkbox-based multi-select for Products and Services in the General Details section of the same form was preserved and remains fully functional.

<optional_next_step>
Ensure the backend API ( endpoint) and associated models/schemas are updated to properly receive and validate the new  and  data from the frontend.
